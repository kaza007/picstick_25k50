![Completed PCB](https://github.com/kaza007/picstick_25k50/blob/master/construction/picstick_25k50_v1_construction_final.jpg)

[Components](https://github.com/kaza007/picstick_25k50/blob/master/construction/picstick_25k50_v1_components.jpg) are to be placed and soldered in the following order to make construction as easy as possible.

Follow the image for the order of placement where each number corresponds to the instruction below.

For components that are not polarised, place them so that you can still read their markings. Resistors can be placed with colour codes reading left to right.

1. Place SW1, switch on the top side of the PCB. It does not matter in which direction it is placed. Solder.
2. Place D2, Red LED on the top side of the PCB. The LED is a polarised part so the long lead must face the X1 crystal. Solder and trim the leads.
3. Optional. Place X1, 16MHz crystal on the top side of the PCB.  It does not matter in which direction it is placed. Solder and trim the leads.
4. Place D1, Red LED on the top side of the PCB. The LED is a polarised part so the long lead must face the USB connector. Solder and trim the leads.
5. Place one side of the pin-header connectors for U1 on the bottom side of the PCB. Solder.
6. Place the other side of the pin-header connectors for U1 on the bottom side of the PCB. Solder.
7. Place R3, 10K resistor on the top side of the PCB. It does not matter in which direction it is placed. Solder and trim the leads.
8. Place R4, 470R resistor on the top side of the PCB. It does not matter in which direction it is placed. Solder and trim the leads.
9. Place C1, 100nF capacitor on the top side of the PCB. It does not matter in which direction it is placed. Solder and trim the leads.
10. Place R1, 470R resistor on the top side of the PCB. It does not matter in which direction it is placed. Solder and trim the leads.
11. Place R2, 470R resistor on the top side of the PCB. It does not matter in which direction it is placed. Solder and trim the leads.
12. Optional. Place C4, 22pF capacitor on the top side of the PCB. It does not matter in which direction it is placed. Solder and trim the leads.
13. Optional. Place C3, 22pF capacitor on the top side of the PCB. It does not matter in which direction it is placed. Solder and trim the leads.
14. Place C2, 220nF capacitor on the top side of the PCB. It does not matter in which direction it is placed. Solder and trim the leads.
15. Place JP2, 14 way pin header on the top side of the PCB. Solder the leads.
16. Place JP1, 14 way pin header on the top side of the PCB. Solder the leads.
17. Place U1, the PIC18F25k50 microcontroller in its socket on the bottom side of the PCB. This will be easier if you first bend the two rows of pins a little bit in towards each other. Note that the microcontroller chip has a notch at one end. This notch must be at the end where the U1 is on the PCB silkscreen.
